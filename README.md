# ðŸ§© Mini Project 2: Array-Based Data Analysis

A simple yet powerful **Python + NumPy** project that performs basic **data analysis** operations such as calculating sum, mean, median, standard deviation, and more. It also demonstrates conditional filtering and normalization of data using NumPy arrays.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Take numeric data input from user
- Display basic data summary (size, shape)
- Perform mathematical and statistical analysis:
  - Sum, Mean, Median
  - Maximum, Minimum
  - Standard Deviation
- Filter values above or below the average
- Transform data:
  - Squared values
  - Normalized (0â€“1 range) data
